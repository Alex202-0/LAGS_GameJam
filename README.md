# LAGS_GameJam

This will be the main repository used for the LAGS GameJam game. 

With this document, I hope to explain how to properly use GitHub with Godot (pull changes, commit and push to branches, ect.) 

# ðŸ”§ Cloning the Project

To get started with this repository, clone it into a desired folder:

**```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git```**

**```cd your-project-name```**


Then, open the project in Godot:

- Launch the Godot Editor.

- Click Import.

- Navigate to the folder you cloned.

- Select the project.godot file.

- Click Open.


# ðŸŒ¿ Branches & Pull Requests
While working on this project, each member should create their own branch to work on new features or bug fixes. This keeps the main branch (main or master) clean and stable.

Here are the steps on how to create brances:

1. Create a new branch for your task:
     ```git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name```
2. Make your changes in Godot and save your work.
3. Stage and commit your changes:

    ```git add .```
    
    ```git commit -m "Added feature X"```

4. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```git push origin your-feature-branch-name```

5. Go to the GitHub page for the repository and open a Pull Request from your branch into main.
